A simple educational practice game for kids and adults.

In version 0.2 there are levels dealing with Math and Language Arts.

The app is designed to allow other level sets, and in the future I'd like to add 
other math levels (ideas: word problems, easier and harder math,  fractions, decimals, time, etc) and other subjects 
as well (ideas: reading, maps, geometry, science, etc?)

Features:
* Progressive levels.
* Slightly gamified.
* Hints given after a bit of time to keep younger players from getting stuck.
* Supports multiple users.
* Big page of all scores.
* Can keep a log of answers in external csv files for record-keeping  purposes (eg homeschooling).

Math Features:
* Basic addition, subtration, multiplication, and division levelsets.
* Some levels multiple choice, some keyboard-entry.
* Sorting of 1, 2, and 3 digit numbers.

Language Arts Features:
* Spelling common words (uses Text-To-Speech)
* Pluralization of common nouns
* Some levels multiple choice, some keyboard-entry.
